# bs-jest - BuckleScript bindings for the Jest test framework [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BuckleTypes/bs-jest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BuckleTypes/bs-jest)

Very very very *experimental* and *WIP*

## Contribute
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-jest.git
cs bs-jest
npm install
```

Then build and run tests with `npm test`, start watchers for `bsb`and `jest` with `npm run watch:bsb` and `npm run watch:jest` respectively. Install `screen` to be able to use `npm run watch:screen` to run both watchers in a single terminal window.
